**Summary:** We modeled adoption using the Bass diffusion equation. Baseline params: `p={{= it.runs[0].params.p }}`, `q={{= it.runs[0].params.q }}`, `M={{= it.runs[0].params.M }}`.

**Observations:**
- Adoption saturates near market size `M`.
- Sensitivity typically ranks `q` (imitation) above `p` (innovation).

**Recommendation:**
- Increase the lever with the highest sensitivity (usually `q`) by targeted social proof interventions for 6â€“8 weeks.
- Expect faster early acceleration with modest cost.
